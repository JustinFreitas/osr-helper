An unimaginatively named module that aims to assist with light, time, and resource management. For use in games using the Foundry Vtt implementation of the 'Old School Essentials' system.
This module provides several macros found in a compendium named "OSR-helper Macros".

### installation

install using the following manifest url:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RabidOwlbear/osr-helper/master/module.json

### usage

Upon initial load a journal entry will be created using the default name of "Turn Count". This journal will be populated with several statistics reflecting number of turns elapsed this session, since that last rest was taken, and the total number of turns so far in the game. Using the provided "OSE-helper Dungeon Turn (base)" macro the Referee can advance the game time in standard 10 minute turn intervals. The "Turn Count" journal will be updated to reflect the current counts.

The provided "OSR-helper reset session count" will reset the session count to zero.
The provided "OSR-helper reset all counts" macro will reset all counts.
The provided "OSR-helper Rest" macro will reset the turns since last rest count to zero.

### Turn Tracker
![turn tracker image](./images/doc/turn-tracker-doc-01.webp)

On the main tab of the tracker the current dungeon turn counts  and dungeon level is desplayed. 
The dungeon level may be increased by pressing one of the arrow buttons on either side. 
The party may rest my using the rest button located in the bottom left corner of the application. 
The dungeon turn may be advanced by clicking the button in the bottom right corner.
The session turn count may be reset using the button in the upper left corner of the application.
The total turn count may be reset by clicking the button in the top right corner. This will open a dialog warning that this change cannot be undone. Click the reset button to reset or close to return to the tracker.

On the config tab (only visible to GM users) The GM may alter the dungeon turn settings. This replaces the dungeon turn settings in the game options. 
- Checking the roll encounters box will roll for encounters based on the frequency determined in the field below.
- The frequency (in turns) determines how often an encounter roll will be performed.
- Checking the Roll for reaction checkbox will roll on the determined reaction table whenever an encounter roll is rolled.
- The roll target input determines the success chance for an encounter roll. The encounter roll is a 1d6 roll under roll.
- The reaction table inout is used to select a table for reaction rolls. The select will list the name of all tables in the game world.
- The Lvl inputs are used to set the encounter table per dungeon level. When an encounter is rolled it will use the current dungeon level to find the correct encounter table. If the dungeon level is 9 or greater the level 8 encounter table will be used.


When the advance dungeon turn button is used, the Turn Tracker will advance the game time by 10 minutes and update the turn counts by one. It will then check the rest count. At 3 turns since last rest a chat message will be created warning the players that they need to rest, at +5 turns the warning becomes red. If the players progress beyond 1 hour without rest, the chat message will then include the relevant penalties, repeating this added text every 5 subsequent turns.

The Tracker will roll any encounter and reaction tables as defined in the config tab.
