An unimaginatively named module that aims to assist with light, time, and resource management. For use in games using the Foundry Vtt implementation of the 'Old School Essentials' system.
This module provides several macros found in a compendium named "OSR-helper Macros".

### Important Notice

If updating from the previous version named "OSE-helper", any macros existing in your game worlds from the previous version will no longer function. Please replace them with the included updated versions. We apologize for any inconvenience this causes.

If you have created custom light items in your world you will need to run the provided conversion macro named "Convert Light Data" located in the included macro compendium "Utility Macros" folder. This wil convert your existing light configurations, existing lights  will not function without conversion. this only needs to be run once.

You will also need to disable and/or uninstall the previous "OSE-CharacterBuilder" installation to avoid conflicts.

### installation

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RabidOwlbear/osr-helper/master/module.json

### usage

Upon initial load a journal entry will be created using the default name of "Turn Count". This journal will be populated with several statistics reflecting number of turns elapsed this session, since that last rest was taken, and the total number of turns so far in the game. Using the provided "OSE-helper Dungeon Turn (base)" macro the Referee can advance the game time in standard 10 minute turn intervals. The "Turn Count" journal will be updated to reflect the current counts.

The provided "OSR-helper reset session count" will reset the session count to zero.
The provided "OSR-helper reset all counts" macro will reset all counts.
The provided "OSR-helper Rest" macro will reset the turns since last rest count to zero.

### Using the OSR-helper Dungeon Turn Macro

To set the options for the dungeon turn macro navigate to the OSE helper settings in module settings.
Clicking the dungeon tirn settings button will open a settings window with the following options:

- Encounter Table Name: Enter the name of the encounter table you wish to roll on here, case sensitive.
- Reaction Table Name: Enter the name of the reaction table you wish to roll on here, case sensitive.
- How often to roll for encounter: How often to roll for encounter. Example: if set to 2 a an encounter check would be rolled every 2nd turn.
- Target to roll below to trigger table roll: Target number to roll under to trigger a table roll.
- Roll For Encounters: If checked encounter rolls will be made using the defined options.
- Roll for Reaction: If checked, when an encounter table is rolled, a roll will be made on the provided reaction table.

When used, the Dungeon Turn macro will advance the game time by 10 minutes and update the turn counts by one. It will then check the rest count,. At 3 turns since last rest a chat message will be created warning the players that they need to rest, at +5 turns the worning becomes red. If the players progress beyond 1 hour without rest, the chat message will then include the relevant penalties, repeating this added text every 5 subsequent turns.

The macro will also check to see if random encounter rolls are active, if so itt will check to see if the number of turns since the last roll is greater than the proc interval (see above), if it is, the macro will roll on the provided table, and if set, roll for reaction on the provided table.

### Custom Lights

Custom light sources can be created by checking the **Enable Light Item Settings Config.** setting in the ose helper module settings. This setting will add a wrench icon to item display for any item with a "Light" tag applied to it in the characters inventory. (The tag needs to be capitalized in order to function correctly.)

The wrench icon (number 1. in image below) will also be added to the header of the item details window, allowing for lights to be configured from the item sidebar tab, or inside compendiums.

Light durations should be a positive number, or "inf" for infinite light duration. (see above)

To activate a light, a player needs access to the provided "Light Toggle " macro. 

To use, a player token must be selected.

When clicked:
- if a light is already lit on the selected token, the light will be extinguished.
- if no light is currently lit, a dialog will be created containing a dropdown populated with the names and quantities of all items in the selected token actors inventory that contain a "Light" tag.
- once a light source is selected, clicking "Light On" with change the selected token's light settings to match tose contained in the selected light source's configuration settings.

note: Several light items have been provided in the OSR-helper Items compendium.
If the macro has been used to light a light source, the light can be extinguished by clicking the macro again, preserving any remaning duration until lit again by clicking the Light On macro and selecting the corresponding light type.

Each time game world time advances, all lit light sources will be checked against their duration, if the duration is exceeded the tight source will be extinguished, and the total quantity for that item will be decremented by 1. If the item quantity is reduced to zero the item will be deleted from the actor's invetory.
